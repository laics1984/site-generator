# CLAUDE.md — Webtree Site Generator

Turns a scraped URL or an uploaded PDF/DOCX into a multi-page site whose JSON
matches the webtree **builder** `BuilderElement` schema 1:1, then pushes it to
the webtree CMS. All LLM calls go to a **locally/self-hosted** OpenAI-compatible
server — never a cloud LLM.

## Where this repo sits

Four sibling repos under `~/Documents/Projects/webtree/`:

| Repo | Stack | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **site-generator** (here) | FastAPI + React | AI generation/scraping only. Its SQLite is ephemeral crawl state, **not** the app datastore. |
| `webtree-cms-api` | Laravel + MySQL | The real backend. Multi-tenant by `entity_id`; public routes are host-based/tokenless, admin routes are JWT + `entity_api_token`. |
| `webtree-public` | Nuxt | Renders the published sites. **Never run `nuxt build` there** — `.nuxt`/`.output` are tracked and served; `npm test` (vitest) only. |
| `webtreesuite-admin-app` | Vue 3 + Vuex | Dashboard. `vue-tsc` is not clean on baseline — don't treat it as a gate. |
| `builder` | React/TS | The visual editor. **Source of truth for the schema and the section catalog.** |

Cross-repo work: check which repo owns the feature before editing. Contact /
lead capture, for example, lives entirely in cms-api + public + admin.

## Commands

```bash
# Run the whole stack (AI server first, then compose)
./dev.sh up            # ./dev.sh down | status
docker compose up --build          # frontend :5174, backend :8001

# Tests — the local py3.11 venv is the reliable path (Docker is often down here)
cd backend && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests           # 59 test modules
cd backend && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_media.py -k overlay -x
backend/scripts/run-tests.sh                             # same suite inside the container

# Contracts / checks
cd backend && python3 scripts/sync_catalog.py --check     # catalog parity with builder
cd backend && python3 scripts/check_catalog_contract.py   # catalog block rules
cd frontend && npm run build                              # tsc -b + vite build (the only typecheck)

# Health
curl localhost:8001/health && curl localhost:8001/health/llm
./ai-server/ai.sh status | up | down | pull | logs
```

`backend/.venv` **must be Python 3.11** — PyMuPDF 1.24.10 has no wheel for
Homebrew's default Python. Recreate with `python3.11 -m venv .venv`.
Playwright for render checks: `backend/.venv/bin/playwright install chromium`.

## Pipeline (detail in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md))

```
URL / document → scraper.py | doc_parser.py → SourceContent
  → planner.py + LLM        → SitePlan (semantic ContentBlocks: hero/features/cta/…)
  → schema_builder.py       → BuilderElement tree   (deterministic; owns ALL styling)
  → push_orchestrator.py    → CMS (pages, media, menus, header/footer, styles, publish)
```

**The LLM never emits `BuilderElement` JSON.** It produces small semantic blocks;
`schema_builder.py` + `style_tokens.py` map them deterministically. Keep it that
way — styling belongs in the mapper (pure, unit-testable), not in prompts, so the
look survives model swaps.

Layered on top: `design_director.py` composes a `DesignManifest` (header/footer
archetypes + a decision log), `diversity.py` steers consecutive sites apart via
SQLite usage history, `hero_director.py`/`theme.py`/`design_brain.py` own hero and
palette choices. See [docs/DESIGN_ENGINE.md](docs/DESIGN_ENGINE.md).

Backend layout: `app/config.py` (all settings), `app/models/`,
`app/routers/` (all mounted under `/api/*` except health), `app/services/` (53
modules — the largest are `schema_builder.py` 4.5k, `scraper.py` 2.6k,
`section_content.py` 1.8k lines).

## Hard contracts — breaking these fails silently

1. **Builder schema parity.** `backend/app/models/builder_schema.py` mirrors
   `../builder/src/lib/site-navigation.ts`. Any drift breaks editor
   compatibility. Change both together. Same for the public schema surface
   (`BrandMood`, `ColorPalette`, `ThemeTokens`, `to_builder_styles`).
2. **Section catalog.** `../builder/src/templates/section-catalog.json` is the
   source of truth; `backend/app/templates/section_catalog.json` is a
   byte-identical vendored copy (`json.dumps(indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)+"\n"`).
   Edit the builder side, then `scripts/sync_catalog.py`.
3. **Header logo naming.** The builder treats a header image as a brand logo only
   when `element.name` matches `/brand/i`; anything else renders as a cropped
   generic image. `header_footer.py` defaults `name="Brand Logo"`. Footer logos
   get no native sizing — they need explicit `width:150px` (not `auto`, which
   collapses to 0), `height:40px`, `minHeight:0`, `objectFit:contain`.
4. **Preview renderer is a port, not a rewrite.** `frontend/src/preview/` mirrors
   `webtree-public`'s renderer. **Don't fix bugs there** — a preview that renders
   better than the live site is still a defect. Fix upstream, then mirror.
   `preview.css` is generated: `node frontend/scripts/vendor-preview-css.mjs ../../webtree-public`.
5. **Config has one home.** Every knob is a field on the `Settings` class in
   `backend/app/config.py` (env name = upper-cased field). No module reads
   `os.environ` — keep it that way. The frontend reads no `import.meta.env`; it
   uses relative paths through the Vite proxy.

## Adding a new section block

Catalog entry in the builder + sync, then wire the generator:
`SectionType` literal + block model + `ContentBlock` union in `content_blocks.py`
→ mapper in `section_content._MAPPERS` → `planner._SCAFFOLD_BLOCK_SCHEMAS`
→ `page_inference._SIGNAL_PATTERNS` + `_SIGNAL_ELIGIBLE_TYPES`. Hero variants
must **also** land in `hero_director._MOOD_SPECS` rotations or they're never
picked. New variants of an existing type need only the catalog entry.

Catalog rules: no `display:grid` (use 2Col/3Col/flex) — the one sanctioned
exception is a `$bento` fan-out container. `$bento` is Python-only; the builder's
TS `materializeTemplate` has no branch for it (known parity gap). Optional
`"moods": [...]` restricts an entry to those brand moods.

## SEO

`services/seo.py` owns the **data**; the CMS renderer owns injection (it wraps
the JSON-LD in `<script type="application/ld+json">` in `<head>`). Don't emit
markup here.

- Homepage → `Organization` + `WebSite`. Restaurant / childcare /
  professional-services (`_LOCAL_INDUSTRIES`) also get `LocalBusiness`.
  Subpages with a chain → `BreadcrumbList`. An FAQ block → `FAQPage`.
- `extract_og_image` walks hero background → split-hero image → first image, and
  skips data URIs.
- **Exactly one `h1` per page.** Legal pages build theirs via `legal_pages._h1`
  (sets `htmlTag="h1"`); heroes carry it elsewhere. Zero or multiple is an audit
  failure.
- Titles must be unique across the site and within the length bounds in
  `ux_audit.py` — duplicate titles/descriptions and missing `ogImage` are flagged
  there. `detect_duplicate_seo` / `detect_orphan_pages` back it.
- **The audit is advisory: it logs and never blocks generation.** If you make it
  blocking you will fail real sites — raise the generator's output quality
  instead.
- `push_orchestrator.py` honours `page.seo.noindex` at push time.

Tests: `test_seo.py`, `test_ux_audit.py`.

## Gotchas

- **Docker dependency skew.** Compose mounts only `./backend/app`, so code edits
  hot-reload but `requirements.txt` additions do **not** reach the container until
  `docker compose build backend`. This burned a whole OCR feature once (silent
  no-op, one INFO line at startup). If a feature acts absent, check the container:
  `docker exec webtree-sitegen-backend python -c "import importlib.util as u; print(u.find_spec('<pkg>'))"`.
- **`.env` lives at the repo root**, not `backend/.env`. pydantic's `env_file` is
  CWD-relative, so the manual `cd backend && uvicorn` path does not pick it up —
  run from the repo root or export. `PEXELS_API_KEY` is one of these.
- **Model config is not in this repo's `.env`.** `LLM_BASE_URL` is all the backend
  knows; engine/model/quant/context/keep-alive live in `ai-server/.env`. The model
  id is discovered from `/v1/models` at runtime. Two roles exist: default (content,
  Qwen3-30B-A3B) and reasoning (`REASONING_*` — brand detection, design brain,
  image judge, GLM-Z1-9B). Kill switches: unset `REASONING_MODEL`,
  `REASONING_THINK=false`, `DESIGN_LANGUAGE_ENABLED=false`.
- **Truncation on content-rich sites** needs `LLM_CTX` (ai-server) *and*
  `LLM_CONTEXT_TOKENS` (here) raised together.
- **`.gitignore` `/lib/` must stay anchored.** An unanchored `lib/` once silently
  swallowed `frontend/src/preview/lib/` — files invisible to `git status`. On a
  Vite "failed to resolve import" for a path that should exist, run
  `git check-ignore -v <path>` before assuming it was never written.
- **This repo is sometimes edited by a second live session.** Re-read files before
  editing and reconcile rather than clobber.
- **Never put CMS/live credentials in chat.** Hand over copy-paste commands with
  placeholders; scripts under `backend/scripts/` default to dry-run and require
  `--apply`.
